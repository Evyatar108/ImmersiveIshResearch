If you've ever wondered how your crashlanded tunnel-dwelling illiterates are able to know how and what to research, then this is probably the mod for you.

This mod makes quite a few changes to the research portion of the game, and how research is progressed throughout the game.

Features:

Ancient Datadisks
- Scattered throughout the (rim)world are old Glitterworld datadisks, which must be decoded to discover their contents.
- Datadisk contents can range from invaluable research data, all the way to completely useless and extremely valuable.
- Random flavour text is added to some types of datadisks for better immersion.

Datadisk Analyzer
- This is a new construct that links to either type of research bench, similar to the Multi-Analyzer. When sufficiently powered and connected, you will be able to decode any locked datadisks you own, and load any research disks you own.

Research Progression
- Research options are now obtained by locating and decoding locked datadisks, found in various locations in the game.
- When a research disk is loaded, a research option is chosen based on a unique weighting, depending on its tech level, and whether any of its prerequsite technologies are completed.
- Locked research options are now hidden from view, and are only visible when a research disk is loaded into the datadisk analyzer.
